Made my website for CS 52 Short Assignment 1 at manmeetgujral.me.
Pulled a cool css animation for extra credit from http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/creative-css-animations/ and integrated
it into the website. The site also adjusts for mobile devices, which is a feature I got the idea from Alex Beals when discussing this assignment with him.
